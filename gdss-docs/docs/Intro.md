### GDSS Simulator Version 1.0

**User Manual and System Documentation**


#### Introduction and Purpose
The **Group Decision Support System (GDSS) Simulator** provides a platform for testing and comparing different **decision fusion techniques**. When multiple agents or experts provide input on a decision, this software combines their inputs using various mathematical and artificial intelligence methods to produce a single, unified result.

Think of it this way: imagine several people estimating the probability of an event happening. Each person gives a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means "**definitely won't happen**" and 1 means "**definitely will happen**." The GDSS Simulator takes all these estimates and combines them into one final probability using different combination strategies.

This tool serves researchers, students, and professionals who need to understand how different fusion techniques affect group decisions. Whether you're studying decision theory, building consensus systems, or comparing algorithm performance, this simulator provides a practical testing environment.
