### System Requirements:

* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or modern Linux distribution
* **Memory:** Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
* **Storage:** 500 MB free space
* **Prerequisites:** **Python 3.7** or newer must be installed separately
* **Required Python packages:** `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation Steps:

1.  **Extract the Software:** If you received a compressed file (.zip or .tar.gz), extract it to a folder of your choice. Avoid system-protected folders like Program Files unless you have administrative rights.
2.  **Python Installation:**
    * Visit [python.org](https://python.org/) and download the latest Python 3 release
    * During installation, check the option "**Add Python to PATH**"
    * After installation, open a command prompt or terminal
    * Type: `pip install numpy scikit-learn`
    * Wait for the packages to download and install
3.  **Script Setup:** The software comes with five Python scripts in a "**scripts**" folder. These should remain in their original location relative to the main application. If you move them, you'll need to update the script path in the application settings.
4.  **First Launch:** Double-click the **GDSS executable file**. The first launch might take a few moments as the system initializes. If you see security warnings about unknown publishers, you may need to click "**Run anyway**" or adjust your security settings.
5.  **Verification:** Once the main window appears, try adding a few test values (like 0.5, 0.7, 0.3) and clicking "**Run Fusion**." If you see a result appear, the installation is successful.
