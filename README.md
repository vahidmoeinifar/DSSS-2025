### 1. Topic Title:
## Intelligent Group Decision Support System Simulator Based on Information Fusion and AI Methods

### 2. Abstract:
This project aims to design and implement a prototype Group Decision Support System (GDSS) that integrates multiple information sources using AI-based fusion techniques. The system will simulate multiple decision-making agents, each with independent information inputs and uncertainty levels. The goal is to fuse their opinions into a single, collective decision using probabilistic and AI-driven fusion models. The prototype will provide a visual interface using **Qt Quick** to display the decision process dynamically.


### 2. Abstract

This project aims to design and implement a prototype **Group Decision Support System (GDSS)** that integrates multiple information sources using **AI-based fusion techniques**. The system will simulate multiple decision-making agents, each with independent information inputs and uncertainty levels. The goal is to fuse their opinions into a single, collective decision using probabilistic and AI-driven fusion models.  

The prototype will utilize a **C++ backend** for high-performance computation and seamless integration with **Qt**, while leveraging **Python** for the AI logic and data processing layers. This hybrid architecture ensures both computational efficiency and flexibility in model experimentation. The **Qt framework** allows for smooth interoperability between C++ and Python modules, enabling advanced visualization and interaction features.  

A **visual dashboard** will be implemented using **Qt Quick (QML)** to dynamically represent agents, decision fusion processes, and collective outcomes in real time. QML provides a highly responsive and GPU-accelerated interface, ideal for AI-driven simulations and multi-agent visualization.

>### 2. Abstract

This project designs and implements a prototype **Group Decision Support System (GDSS)** that integrates multiple information sources using **AI-based fusion techniques**. It simulates multiple agents with uncertain inputs and fuses their opinions into a collective decision via probabilistic and AI-driven fusion models.

A **C++ backend** ensures computational efficiency, while **Python** handles AI logic and data processing. The **Qt framework** connects both languages smoothly, supporting high-speed operations and real-time visualization. The **Qt Quick (QML)** dashboard will display agent interactions and fusion outcomes dynamically.

### ðŸ’¡ Why Qt Quick
 >**Qt Quick (QML)** offers the best mix of **speed, flexibility, and integration** for this simulator.  
> - **Performance:** GPU-accelerated for smooth real-time visualization.  
>- **Integration:** Connects directly with **C++** and **Python (PySide6/PyQt)** modules.  
>- **Scalability:** Modular design supports easy expansion.  
>- **Professional UI:** Industry-grade visuals for simulation and decision systems.  
>#### MATLAB Integration
>As my supervisor uses MATLAB, **Qt Quick** allows deploying existing MATLAB code into the new project through the **MATLAB Engine API for C++** or **Python**, enabling seamless reuse and integration of pre-written algorithms within the simulator.
